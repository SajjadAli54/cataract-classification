Methodology

Data Visualization
	5 techniques
	BGR : Blue Green Red
	RGB : Red Green Blue
	Graye Level
	Adaptive Threshold Gray Level
	Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features 
		'dissimilarity', 'contrast', 'homogeneity', 'energy', 'ASM', 'correlation'

Data Augmentation
	Augmented by Gaussian Filter
	30% data of each class is augmented and then saved.
	30% increase in data (600 to 750+)

Feature Extraction using GLCM
	'dissimilarity', 'contrast', 'homogeneity', 'energy', 'ASM', 'correlation'
	Their Mathematical formulas and little explaination of each

Models (Five models)
	SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes

Selection models technique
	Learning curve
	Validation Curve

	Both use Stratified KFold cross validation by default

Metrics
	Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC ROC score

Conclusion
	KNN performs better most of the time. It gave a better accuracy of almost 64% with auc roc score of 
	0.90 as  compare to other five models. Analyzed overfitting, underfitting, variance, and bias too.
